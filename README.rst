About
=====

The Sphinx Unbloated Theme is a minimal, clean HTML theme for
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. It is built on Sphinx's ``basic``
theme, the only dependency, and uses vanilla CSS with no third-party
frameworks or bundlers.

The theme is intentionally small: a single well-organised CSS file, a Jinja2
layout template, and a handful of configuration options. It is designed to be
easy to read, easy to override, and fast to load.

Installation
============

Ensure your environment meets the `prerequisites`_. Then follow the
`installation guidelines`_ for step-by-step instructions.

Quick install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sphinx-unbloated-theme

Then set the theme in your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   html_theme = "sphinx_unbloated_theme"

Documentation
=============

The `official documentation`_ contains the following sections:

- `Getting started`_. A brief overview of the theme, prerequisites, and
  installation instructions to get your documentation site up and running
  in minutes.

- `User guide`_. Detailed documentation of all configuration options,
  layout conventions, and CSS customisation hooks. This is the right place
  to learn how to tailor the theme to your project.

- `API reference`_. Auto-generated reference for the public Python API
  exposed by the theme package (Sphinx extension hooks, version helpers,
  etc.).

- `Examples`_. A gallery of self-contained scientific Python notebooks that
  demonstrate the theme rendering prose, code blocks, maths, figures, and
  interactive output.

- `Changelog`_. A version-by-version summary of notable changes, bug fixes,
  and new features.

Contributing
============

Read the `contribution guide`_ for setup, documentation builds, tests, and
changelog fragments. Contributions follow the `code of conduct`_. To report
a vulnerability, use the contact in the `security policy`_.

Development
===========

GitHub Actions uses three workflows:

- ``ci_cd_pr.yml`` checks pull requests, builds wheels on Linux and Windows
  with Python 3.12 and 3.13, builds the documentation, and runs the browser
  tests. It uploads the HTML documentation and package distributions.
- ``ci_cd_night.yml`` runs on pushes to ``main``, daily at 00:00 UTC, and
  on manual runs. The manual inputs select documentation deployment and
  tests. Documentation builds also run when tests need them.
- ``ci_cd_release.yml`` runs on ``v*.*.*`` tags. After the checks pass, it
  publishes the package to PyPI and GitHub and deploys stable and versioned
  documentation. The tag must match the package version.

Development and release documentation use ``WEBSITE_DEPLOY_KEY`` to publish
to the ``gh-pages`` branch of ``jorgepiloto/website``.

For PyPI releases, configure a `trusted publisher
<https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/>`_ for
``ci_cd_release.yml`` and the ``release`` environment.

Troubleshooting
===============

repository:

- Go to the `project repository`_.
- Click the **Issues** tab.
- Click **New Issue**.
- Provide a clear description of the problem, including any error messages,
  code snippets, or screenshots that help reproduce it.
